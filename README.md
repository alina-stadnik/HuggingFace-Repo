## **Hugging-Face ðŸ¤— Explorations**

Welcome to my repository of studies exploring various applications of pre-trained models available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/). This repository serves as a space for testing, experimenting, and documenting interesting applications using state-of-the-art machine learning models.

________

### **Contents**

This repository contains notebooks covering the following tasks:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Using models to analyze text sentiment, useful for understanding customer/user feedback, and more.
2. **Question Answering**: Implementation of question-answering models to extract relevant information from given passages.
3. **Zero-Shot Classification**: Models for classifying data without labeled training examples. Used here to categorize products into predefined labels, which is especially useful for e-commerce and content categorization.
4. **Background Removal**: Techniques to remove backgrounds from images, enhancing visuals for applications like photo editing, product displays, and more.
